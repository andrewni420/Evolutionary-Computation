;;;   Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning     ;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; Overview:
;;; At its core, this instance of competitive (co)evolutionary reinforcement learning
;;; is just a genetic algorithm in which individuals play other individuals to
;;; determine the fitness function
;;; 
;;; The structure of the coevolutionary loop is as follows:
;;; 1. Initialization of population
;;;        As in https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864 
;;;        an individual is initialized as a single integer that seeds a random number generator.
;;;        This random number generator is then used to initialize the weights of the transformer
;;;        neural net using Xavier initialization, where each parameter is drawn from a normal
;;;        distribution with mean 0 and stdev 1/âˆšN where N is the number of incoming neurons
;;;        This instantiation of Xavier initialization was proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852
;;; 2. Fitness evaluation
;;;        Much of the work on coevolution revolves around this fitness evaluation, as
;;;        the nonstationarity of the environment makes it difficult to design a fitness
;;;        function that pushes generations toward optimal solutions while avoiding common
;;;        pathologies like local minima, cycling, and evolutionary forgetting.
;;;        Common evaluation methods implemented here are as follows:
;;;            Single-elimination tournament: Individuals are randomly paired up, each pair plays games against each other,
;;;                and the winning player moves on to the next round. Unpaired individuals automatically progress. 
;;;                The fitness of an individual is the highest round reached by that individual
;;;                This fitness evaluation method has the advantage of devoting more resources towards
;;;                differentiating between very good individuals, but is difficult to parallelize and is 
;;;                very selective, leading to local optima. Therefore it's used to select an elite "best" individual for each generation
;;;            Benchmarking: A group of individuals, from the current population and/or a hall of fame, are chosen as
;;;                benchmarks. Every individual in the current population plays against every benchmark individual, and the
;;;                fitness function is the amount of money won/lost against each benchmark individual.
;;;                This fitness function is easily parallelizable and highly tunable to different distributions
;;;                of benchmark individuals, and so is used as the main fitness evaluation function.
;;;            K-Random: Each individual plays against K random other individuals in the population, as in http://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gecco2002/GA155.pdf
;;;                Matches may contribute to the fitness functions of just one of the players or to both. This is just
;;;                as parallelizable as benchmarking, but makes it difficult to tell which individuals are better due to 
;;;                each individual having a unique set of opponents. This is mostly used in the round-robin extreme during
;;;                hyperparameter search to compare the best individuals evolved by multiple hyperparameter settings
;;; 3. Parent selection
;;;        Generic epsilon lexicase selection, treating the benchmark individuals as test cases, is used here
;;;        When selecting each parent, the benchmarking individuals are randomly shuffled. Then proceeding down
;;;        the sequence of benchmarking individuals, the average amount won against that benchmark is calculated 
;;;        over the whole population. Then the median absolute deviation from the mean is calculated. The cutoff 
;;;        winning amount against this individual is computed by the highest amount won less the median absolute deviation.
;;;        Any individual winning more than this cutoff survives to the next test case. This process is then repeated
;;;        until only one individual is left, or until the test cases are exhausted, in which case a random individual is
;;;        selected from those remaining
;;; 4. Mutation
;;;        As in the two papers cited above, https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864, a mutation is 
;;;        represented as the concatenation of another int to the individual's growing collection of random seeds. This sequence
;;;        of seeds, along with a preset global mutation standard deviation, is a compact representation of the uniform gaussian
;;;        mutations taken to reach this point. This representation lends itself much more easily to distributed computing, as 
;;;        only a couple hundred integers need to be communicated per individual, instead of millions of parameter weights.
;;;        It is also possible to implement an annealing schedule for the mutation strength, as in https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3205455.3205589
;;; 5. Repeat until the end of the cycle
;;;        As ERL is very computationally intensive, I will try to train mostly at night when no one new is going to need a HPC node.
;;;        To facilitate this, I'll need to be able to pick up and leave off evolution at any time. That functionality will either be
;;;        in this file or in process-result.clj

;;; Functions: 
;;; versus plays two individuals against each other and returns the match results
;;; benchmark implements the benchmark fitness evaluation described above
;;; single-elim implements the single-elimination tournament fitness evaluation
;;;     described above
;;; round-robin implements the K-random fitness evaluation described above
;;; lexicase-selection implements the epsilon-lexicase selection described above
;;; cull-hof attempts to remove consistently bad, and therefore unhelpful, individuals
;;;    from the hall of fame
;;; select-from-hof implements random selection, k-best as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05610.pdf, or 
;;;    exponential selection, in which hof individuals from later generations are exponentially more
;;;    likely to be selected as benchmarks to maintain a balance between skilled individuals providing
;;;    selection pressure and earlier individuals preventing evolutionary forgetting and smoothing out convergence.
;;; ERL implements the evolutionary reinforcement learning cycle, reporting out at each generation the
;;;    generation number, the current population, and the time taken for fitness evaluations. I will have
;;;    to implement truncation of game length as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864 for better CPU utilization

   ms is reported out.\\
   Before starting the next cycle, the generation number is incremented, the hall of fame is updated

   of actions available to evaluate individuals is set to 2x the average number of actions taken to evaluate
