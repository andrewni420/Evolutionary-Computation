## [AIVAT: A New Variance Reduction Technique for Agent Evaluation in Imperfect Information Games](AIVAT-%20A%20New%20Variance%20Reduction%20Technique%20for%20Agent%20Evaluation%20in%20Imperfect%20Information%20Games.pdf)
State of the art variance reduction technique. Enables statistically significant results in as little as 1000-10000 poker games
May be computationally costly. I think it was mainly intended for use when pitting models against human opponents.
Based on accurate evaluation of baselines for every event with random chance to account for how much random chance contributes to the agent’s success or failure
## [AlphaHoldem](AlphaHoldem.pdf)
Neural Net poker agent. Convolutional nets -> fully connected layers -> action prediction
Beats Slumbot
## [Building an Efficient Poker Agent Using RL](Building%20an%20Efficient%20Poker%20Agent%20Using%20RL.pdf)
## [Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and Search for Imperfect-Information Games](Combining%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20and%20Search%20for%20Imperfect-Information%20Games.pdf)
## [DIVAT - A Tool For The Direct Assessment of Poker Decisions](DIVAT%20-%20A%20Tool%20For%20The%20Direct%20Assessment%20of%20Poker%20Decisions.pdf)
Less complicated, less powerful version of AIVAT and MIVAT
## [DeepStack- Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker](DeepStack-%20Expert-level%20artificial%20intelligence%20in%20heads-up%20no-limit%20poker.pdf)
CFR-based HeadsUp No Limit agent. Weaker than Slumbot. Weaker version of OpenStack (Unlocking the potential…)
## [Generating Novice Heuristics for Post-Flop Poker](Generating%20Novice%20Heuristics%20for%20Post-Flop%20Poker.pdf)
Uses genetic programming to generate separate decision trees for each round of post-flop poker.
Not particularly strong, but explainable agents. 
They also have a paper generating heuristics for pre-flop poker
## [Improving a Case-Based Texas Hold'em Poker Bot](Improving%20a%20Case-Based%20Texas%20Hold'em%20Poker%20Bot.pdf)
## [MIVAT - Learning a Value Analysis Tool For Agent Evaluation](MIVAT%20-%20Learning%20a%20Value%20Analysis%20Tool%20For%20Agent%20Evaluation.pdf)
Less complicated, less powerful version of AIVAT
## [On novelty driven evolution in Poker](On%20novelty%20driven%20evolution%20in%20Poker.pdf)
## [OpenHoldem - A Benchmark for Large-Scale Imperfect-Information Game Research](OpenHoldem%20-%20A%20Benchmark%20for%20Large-Scale%20Imperfect-Information%20Game%20Research.pdf)
Supposedly provides a website platform to compare holdem agents. I couldn’t actually access their website
## [Player of Games](Player%20of%20Games.pdf)
Google’s LSTM agent to play a wide variety of games. Slightly better than Slumbot
## [Superhuman AI For Multiplayer Poker](Superhuman%20AI%20For%20Multiplayer%20Poker.pdf)
Pluribus, an agent to play multiple people. Beat professionals in the following 6-player formats: 1 professional and 5 Pluribus agents and 1 Pluribus agent and 5 professionals. 
Computes a baseline strategy offline and adapts to play dynamically.
## [The challenge of poker](The%20challenge%20of%20poker.pdf)
## [Unlocking the Potential of Deep Counterfactual Networks](Unlocking%20the%20Potential%20of%20Deep%20Counterfactual%20Value%20Networks.pdf)
OpenStack, the upgraded version of DeepStack. A CFR agent that’s better than Slumbot
