# Transformer Paper Descriptions
## [Attention is All You Need](Attention%20is%20All%20You%20Need.pdf)
Pioneer paper in transformers. 

Explains why transformers are better than LSTMs

Uses a 6xEncoder -> 6xDecoder architecture
## [BERT- Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](BERT-%20Pre-training%20of%20Deep%20Bidirectional%20Transformers%20for%20Language%20Understanding.pdf)
## [Decision Transformer - Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling](Decision%20Transformer%20-%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20via%20Sequence%20Modeling.pdf)
First paper to apply transformers to RL. 

Offline RL formulated as a sequence modeling problem - model the sequence (R S A ...) obtained from random walk where R = reward-to-go, S = state, A = action

Trained to accurately predict A given previous sequence.

Able to display different skill levels during inference by controlling the value of R

## [Deep Transformer Q-Networks for Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](Deep%20Transformer%20Q-Networks%20for%20Partially%20Observable%20Reinforcement%20Learning.pdf)
## [Dropout - A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting](Dropout%20-%20A%20Simple%20Way%20to%20Prevent%20Neural%20Networks%20from%20Overfitting.pdf)
A description of dropout, where weights in a network are randomly set to zero during each training iteration. Helps prevent weights from coadapting, helps prevent the network from being too brittle, helps the network learn generalizable features.
Dropout is used in transformers
